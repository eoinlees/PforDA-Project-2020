# Programming for Data Analytics - Project 2020
## Eoin Lees - G00387888 - December 2020

The following program is a project for the programming for data analytics module in December 2020. 

It's purpose was to simulate a real world phenomenon using existing data and numpy. 

It is run using Jupyter notebooks.

It can be read directly from git hub, however for full functionallity please download and run directly from your desktop. 

### Jupyter notebooks
* Installation
    Visit https://jupyter.org/ and follow instructions to install on your macine
* To Run
    Navigate to the correct folder in the console and type the following command: Jupyter notebooks
    Use the gui provided in the web explorer and select `Project-2020.ipynb`

### Problem statement

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:
* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and theirrelationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.


Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some
students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to
base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),
but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section
gives an example project idea.


### Results

After compiling all of the research and information into the summary jupyter notebook document I believe I have a much deeper understanding of how to simulate a data set using python. I am confident that in future usage of the package I will be able to refer back to this document and use it as a starting off point for working on problems.
