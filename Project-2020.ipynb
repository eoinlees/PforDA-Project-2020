    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should `model and synthesise such data using Python.`\n",
    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "    Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",

    "Note that `this project is about simulation` – you must synthesise a data set. Some\n",

    "base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),\n",
